--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project consists of a B-tree implementation in C++ designed for efficient management of sorted data. The B-tree offers functionalities such as insertion, deletion, and search operations. Additionally, the implementation provides features to find the predecessor and successor of a key, as well as printing keys within a specified range.
Features

    Insertion and Deletion: Efficient methods to add and remove elements while maintaining the sorted order of the B-tree.
    Search Operation: Quickly find specific keys within the B-tree.
    Predecessor and Successor: Identify the key that precedes or succeeds a given value.
    Range Query: Print keys falling within a specified range.

Usage

    Insertion: Add elements to the B-tree using the insert operation.
    Deletion: Remove elements from the B-tree using the remove operation.
    Search: Check the existence of a key using the search operation.
    Predecessor and Successor: Retrieve the key that comes before or after a given value.
    Range Query: Print keys within a specified range using the afisare operation.

How to Run

Compile and execute the main.cpp file, providing input as described in the file. The program reads operations from a file (abce.in) and outputs results to another file (abce.out).
